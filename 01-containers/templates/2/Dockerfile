FROM golang:alpine

# creates the executable named goapp
RUN go build -o goapp

# If you run docker build on this file, you should notice that it is quite big. Especially for a small hello world app.
# Try to answer why the image is so big and write the size down. Google is your friend :D


# TODO: Refactor the above to be a multi-staged Dockerfile.

# In the first part of the multi staged build, you should try and build the executable from the the given hello.go file.
# You can use golang:alpine as a base. Remember this is a multi staged build.
# In the example above it tells you how to build a go executable.






# In the second part of the multi staged build, you should try and copy the executable and run it.
# You should use gcr.io/distroless/static as the second base.
# When you build and run the image, what size difference do you end up with?
